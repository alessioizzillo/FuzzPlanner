# FuzzPlanner
Welcome to the FuzzPlanner tool repository! This repository will serve as the official home for the FuzzPlanner tool: a visual analytics solution designed to support security operators in the process of designing fuzzing campaigns for device firmware. 

## Release Information

We're excited to announce that the FuzzPlanner tool will be made available ahead of its presentation at IEEE Symposium on Visualization for Cyber Security (VizSec) 2023.

## Key Features

FuzzPlanner offers a range of novel visual aids that enable operators to identify optimal candidates for fuzzing within firmware images. The tool's distinctive capabilities facilitate the identification of critical binaries, aiding in the selection of targets for fuzzing campaigns. Its effectiveness has been validated through real-world scenarios involving firmware images.

## Presentation at VizSec

We're excited to share our findings and insights with the community during the upcoming VizSec presentation. FuzzPlanner's contributions to the field of firmware fuzzing, coupled with its utilization of visual analytics techniques, aims to solve security challenges in embedded device environments.

Thank you for your interest in FuzzPlanner!
